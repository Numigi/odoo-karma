# Karma Grades

This module adds grades to Karma.

A new tab `Results` is added to the karma form view.

![Results Tab](static/description/karma_results_tab.png?raw=true)

Each Karma score is given a grade.
The grade is computed based on a set of ranges defined on the Karma.

In the picture above, if a result is:

* lower than 10, then the grade is WEAK
* between 10 and 20, then the grade is GOOD
* higher or equal to 20, then the grade is NICE

In the form view of the object, the grade will be displayed on the karma widget.
