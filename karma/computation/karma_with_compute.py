        This method serves as a standard hook to add a extra behavior
        before or after the computation of a karma score.

        The objective is to prevent as possible coupling with modules
        that extend karma features from the main computation algorithm.

        The karma computation details are isolated inside the
        ConditionKarmaComputer and InheritedKarmaComputer classes.
